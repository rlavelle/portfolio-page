Personal portfolio webpage project. Template was taken from [github](https://github.com/crearo/portfolio). The LICENSE has been left in for credit to the creator. Code has been cut down to the bear minimum for a stylistic starting point.

### Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to showcase my previous AI/ML projects by wrapping their existing models in Flask API's, and making interactive pages for each project.


### Current status of project

As of right now the project is still in the setup phase, I am cleaning up the previous projects code, and writing the page descriptions for each project. The next step will be to wrap each projects model in a Flask API.
