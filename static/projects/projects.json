      "short": "Created a chess AI which uses case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule based heuristics to improve alpha beta search in chess. CBR is used to find optimal opening moves, and rule based heuristics are used to prune unnecessary moves lightening the load of the alpha-beta minimax algorithm. A genetic algorithm was used to compute the optimal weights for the evaluation heuristic",
